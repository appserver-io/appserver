# Introduction

The objective of the project is to develop a multi-threaded application server for PHP, written in PHP. Yes, pure PHP! You think we 
aren't serious? Maybe! But we think, in order to enable as many developers in our great community, this will be the one and only way. 
So with your help we hopefully establish a solution as the standard for enterprise applications in PHP environments.

# Roadmap

As we're in heavy development it may be, that we've to move some tasks from the following roadmap to a earlier/later version, please 
be aware of that. If you've got ideas or features that definitely have to be in one of the next releases, please contact us. We're 
always open for new ideas or feedback.

And yes, we have plans for a Community and an Enterprise edition. The Community Edition will provide all functionality needed to develop, 
run and maintain all kind of web applications. The Enterprise Edition will focus on large software solutions that run on many servers and 
need advanced features like cluster functionality.
