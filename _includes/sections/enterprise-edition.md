***

We had many, interesting, discussions with experienced PHP core developers about the possibilities and pitfalls that multithreading in a language like PHP comes along with. Most of them thought, that it still will **not** be possible to provide a stable and high performant server implementation as base for an application server. Months later, we think, we can refute that: You do not believe it? Have a look at our [CE](<{{ "/products/community-edition.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}>)!

We have a vision for the future of PHP!

> After finishing the first **real** PHP Application Server that allows stateful, enterprise-grade application development, we think, that PHP is now ready to make the next big step into the Java dominated enterprise market. As Open Source driven service provider, focused on [Magento](http://magento.com), [TYPO3 CMS](http://typo3.org/typo3-cms) and [TYPO3 Neos](http://typo3.org/typo3-neos) projects, we faced various problems when we tried to scale out growing businesses. Exactly that has been the reason, why we decided to start appserver.io CE and will now complement it with an EE, providing out-of-the-box solutions for requirements of mid- and enterprise range web applications.

Millions of developers and great, simple to use and easy to install applications made PHP the most used language for developing web applications these days. **80 percent market share can not be wrong!** But out there, another huge market, not yet recognized by the PHP ecosystem, is still waiting to be optained by us. You may wonder, what we are talking about? About the financial, insurance and industry market, which has, regarding a Gartner analysis from 2011, a volume of about **17 billion dollars**. Completely covered by big players as IBM's Websphere, Oracle's WebLogic and JBoss EAP, we think it's time to tear out a big piece of that cake for the PHP ecosystem. 

To play with the big ones, we think, PHP needs a bunch of solutions, to satisfy the requirements for performance, scalability, maintainability and last but not least security, these market requests. Have a look what solutions we've in mind for appserver.io, and what we're talking about.
